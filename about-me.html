She earned her undergraduate degree from Howard University where she majored in Africana studies. Her research interests include Black migration, heritage, Africana archaeology, underwater archaeology, and Africana womanism. Through these interests, Black digital humanities emerges as a common methodology in her work, drawing on Kim Gallon's understanding of digital humanitites as a technology of recovery. </p><hr><p> </p><p> </p><p>This project details my experience as a Black woman going from being scared of the ocean to a scientific scuba diver.

Afraid of the ocean? Let me explain-</p><p>Growing up in Colorado the beach was not something I felt particularly called to. I didn't spend much time in swimming pools (please, as if I would get my hair wet in public).<strong class="x-el x-el-span c1-1d c1-1e c1-b c1-90 c1-4i c1-5k c1-91"> I didn't feel the need to learn how to swim</strong> (I mean, for what?)</p><p>However, my sophomore year at Howard University I was taught how to swim. If you saw me, you might not have called it swimming but I kept my head above water! <strong class="x-el x-el-span c1-1d c1-1e c1-b c1-90 c1-4i c1-5k c1-91">I felt silly and embarrassed that I was so behind- learning this skill at 19.</strong> But there was something so calming about letting myself relax in the ocean. </p><p>Fast forward years later, I am now obtaining my PhD to conduct archaeological research underwater by scuba diving. <strong class="x-el x-el-span c1-1d c1-1e c1-b c1-90 c1-4i c1-5k c1-91">I could say I healed, I could say I am fearless, but the truth is I am still scared of the ocean. </strong></p><p>This quarter, I took a class to get my scientific scuba diving certification. As the only Black woman in the class, I felt anxieties and insecurities rise. I stressed about my hair, I felt like I was flailing compared to my classmates who glided through the pool, and I feared judgment from those who waited in the water while I took my necessary deep breaths before I jumped in. I began contemplating why I felt such anxieties during an activity that truly <strong class="x-el x-el-span c1-1d c1-1e c1-b c1-90 c1-4i c1-5k c1-91">makes me feel calm and peaceful.</strong> </p><p>This project is a result of those feelings- I turned both inward and outward to try to understand not only my narrative with water, but the<strong class="x-el x-el-span c1-1d c1-1e c1-b c1-90 c1-4i c1-5k c1-91"> narratives of people I care about </strong>around me. What are their stories? <strong class="x-el x-el-span c1-1d c1-1e c1-b c1-90 c1-4i c1-5k c1-91">How can we feel empowered in the water?</strong> Where do these anxieties come from and what stories do we share?</p></div><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://jewellhumphrey.github.io/the-water-is-waiting/get-involved.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Get Involved </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://jewellhumphrey.github.io/the-water-is-waiting/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img style="border-width: 0;" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png" alt="Creative Commons License"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://jewellhumphrey.github.io/the-water-is-waiting/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://jewellhumphrey.github.io/the-water-is-waiting/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
