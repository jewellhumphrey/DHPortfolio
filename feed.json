Afraid of the ocean? Let me explain-</p>\n<p>Growing up in Colorado the beach was not something I felt particularly called to. I didn't spend much time in swimming pools (please, as if I would get my hair wet in public).<strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-1d c1-1e c1-b c1-90 c1-4i c1-5k c1-91\"> I didn't feel the need to learn how to swim</strong> (I mean, for what?)</p>\n<p>However, my sophomore year at Howard University I was taught how to swim. If you saw me, you might not have called it swimming but I kept my head above water! <strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-1d c1-1e c1-b c1-90 c1-4i c1-5k c1-91\">I felt silly and embarrassed that I was so behind- learning this skill at 19.</strong> But there was something so calming about letting myself relax in the ocean. </p>\n<p>Fast forward years later, I am now obtaining my PhD to conduct archaeological research underwater by scuba diving. <strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-1d c1-1e c1-b c1-90 c1-4i c1-5k c1-91\">I could say I healed, I could say I am fearless, but the truth is I am still scared of the ocean. </strong></p>\n<p>This quarter, I took a class to get my scientific scuba diving certification. As the only Black woman in the class, I felt anxieties and insecurities rise. I stressed about my hair, I felt like I was flailing compared to my classmates who glided through the pool, and I feared judgment from those who waited in the water while I took my necessary deep breaths before I jumped in. I began contemplating why I felt such anxieties during an activity that truly <strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-1d c1-1e c1-b c1-90 c1-4i c1-5k c1-91\">makes me feel calm and peaceful.</strong> </p>\n<p>This project is a result of those feelings- I turned both inward and outward to try to understand not only my narrative with water, but the<strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-1d c1-1e c1-b c1-90 c1-4i c1-5k c1-91\"> narratives of people I care about </strong>around me. What are their stories? <strong class=\"x-el x-el-span c1-1d c1-1e c1-b c1-90 c1-4i c1-5k c1-91\">How can we feel empowered in the water?</strong> Where do these anxieties come from and what stories do we share?</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>",
